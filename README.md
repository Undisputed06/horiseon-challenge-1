## Description 

This week I received a ticket to refactor code provided  by the marketing company Horiseon to make their website more accessible to visitors. I included descriptive alt atributes and improved the semantic structure of the index.html page. I also followed the Scout Rule by correting broken links, properly commenting the CSS file, and consolidating and organizing CSS selectors and properties to follow semantic structure.
